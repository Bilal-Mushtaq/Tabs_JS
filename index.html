    <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”. <br>
      The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads. <br> 
      Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don''t need special preparation or compilation to run. <br>
      In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java. <br>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="Green" class="tabcontent">
    <p>Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it. <br>
      JavaScript's capabilities greatly depend on the environment it's running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc. <br>
      In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.<br>
      JavaScript's abilities in the browser are limited for the sake of a user's safety. The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from accessing private information or harming the user's data.
    </p>

  <div id="Blue" class="tabcontent">
    <p>The syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone's needs. Different people want different features. <br>
      That's to be expected, because projects and requirements are different for everyone.  <br>
      So recently a plethora of new languages appeared, which are transpiled (converted) to JavaScript before they run in the browser.     <br> 
      Modern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent, actually allowing developers to code in another language and auto-converting it “under the hood”. <br>
